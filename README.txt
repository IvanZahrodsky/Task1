Task:

1 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function that returns 
the next even number for a given unsigned long integer.

2 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function 
that organizes ascending given two signed long integers.

3 :

Using only bit operation, write a function that returns 
the 1 if the bits in 2-preset positions unsigned long integer different.

15 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function that 
returns 1 if the given unsigned long integer x is a power of 2, x - {0,1,2,4,8,...}


16 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function that 
returns unsigned long integer 
that contains block of 1 bits length n starting with p bit

17 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function 
that returns the absolute value of the difference of two given signed long integers.

18 :

Using only bit operation, write a function that returns 1 if the binary code 
for x no two consecutive 1 and 0 - otherwise; x - unsigned long integer.

19 :

Using only bit operation, write a function that interchanges 
adjacent groups of 4 bits in a given unsigned long integer.

20 :

Using only bit and arithmetic operations, write a function 
that performs a cyclic shift given an unsigned long integer to r bits left.

21 :

Using only bit operation, write a function that returns a value min (0,x)
(0 - while a positive value parameter x, the value x - otherwise); x - a signed long integer.
